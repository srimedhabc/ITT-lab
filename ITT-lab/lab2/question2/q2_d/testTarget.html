<h1>IT DEPT </h1>
<h3> Overview of IT department responsibilities </h3>

One of the biggest drivers of a successful business is efficiency, <br/>
and the ability to automate routine tasks is a great way to increase <br/>
overall efficiency. Generally speaking, the IT department is <br/>
responsible for providing the infrastructure for this automation. <br/> <br/> <br/>

At an even more basic level, by implementing the governance for <br/> 
the use of network and operating systems, the IT department enables <br/>
the companyâ€™s employees to communicate, collaborate and automate <br/>
routine tasks, and generally provide teams with the functionality <br/>
they need to perform their duties. <br/>
